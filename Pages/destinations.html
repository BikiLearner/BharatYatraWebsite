        <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-gray-500">Almost like a colonial matriarch nurturing her heritage roots, the city of Kolkata, the capital 
            of West Bengal, holds culture and tradition close to its heart. While it would give any Indian metropolis a run for its money with its grand structures, 
            bustling markets, vibrant culinary scene, exquisite crafts and cultural sites, its historical legacy reigns supreme. Once the capital of British-India, Kolkata's 
            colonial charm blends with its modern culture.
